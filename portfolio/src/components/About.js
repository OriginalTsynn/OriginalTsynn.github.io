                            Shortly after that, I started programming games in middle school on the TI-83 calculator.  <br></br>
                            Fast forward a little to high school, and I started really getting in to PC based gaming, and as a result, my interest in coding was sparked, so I started studying C++ <br></br>
                            It's been a long road, but I've finally cmoe back to programming after doing nothing with it for a decade. */}

                            Iâ€™ve always had a passion for web design and game design since as far back as I can remember.
                            I started making websites in the mid 1990s, and making games on the TI-83 in the late 1990s.
                            I always knew I wanted to go down this path, and really learn how to bring ideas to life.
                            To that end, as of March 2019, I decided to put my life on hold, and embark an a journey to learn how to code at General Assembly.<br></br><br></br>

                            One of favorite technologies we learned there was React I'm not the greatest with it yet, but I see so much potential with it, heck, this portfolio is done in React!  It's a really powerful tool I suggest most people interested in building websites learn early on.

                            <br></br>

                            In my free time, when not programming, I like to keep my senses sharp by passionately participating in gaming.  <br></br>
                            When not programming or gaming, I spend a lot of time working with my wonderful dogs, 2 female doberman, age 3.
